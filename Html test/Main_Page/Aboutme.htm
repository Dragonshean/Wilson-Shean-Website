                <h1>Sales Representative for 5 years work-experience</h1>
                <p>My major in college is Food Science, but my job is sales. 
                   <br>My first came to Hauming on 03/2018, I was not knowing anything about the textile industrial. 
                   <br>Thanks to the manager who taught me many technical informations, although he only taught me for 6 months before he left the company.
                   <br>I still managed to learn and work independently by myself, so I was able to arrange the exhibition on 11/2018.
                   <br>I took my boss who doesn't speak English to Sri Lanka, attended exhibition and visited my customers.
                   <br>Without any experiences of sales business, but still capable to finish the task.

                <h1>6 months in my father's company.</h1>
                <p>My father established his own transportation company.
                <br>I only stayed for 6 months, help out my mother some paper work.
                <br>And learned how to promote a product to customers.
                <br>After 6 months, I decided to go out for work in others place.
                <br>Because I realized that staying in your comfort zone won't make you grow up.
                <br>So I started interviewing for some sales positions, and I've been at Hauming ever since.

                <h1>I served in Army Airborne Special Forces for 1 year duty</h1>
                <p>For my military duty, I decided to sign in special forces for my personal training.
                <br>I love to challenge myself, and I don't want to get bored during my time in military.
                <br>For airborne special forces, you must schedule a 3 weeks and 56 hours of ground training before parachuting. 
                <br>Ground training has 7 parts, each part has examination test to pass. Then you can start Airborne training.
                <br>Airborne training, you need to jump out the C-130 parachuting for 5 times. 
                <br>After all training done, you will have the Airborne badge. By the way, I had jumped for 12 times then.
